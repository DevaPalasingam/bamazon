# bamazonCustomer

## Overview

This program is meant to simulate purchasing items from a store. The item details and inventory are stored in a database.

When bamazonCustomer.js is run it will first print out the data in the database. 

The user is then prompted to choose which item they would like to purchase.

After they select their item, the user can then input how many units of that item they'd like to purchase. The user will input a number. If the user inputs something other than a number, nothing will happen.

After that, the screen will show the total cost of the user's purchase. The updated database will be printed, then the user will be prompted to make a purchase again.
